## Commentary

**Relationship with computer: I have only had this computer for about a month, so far I've enjoyed using it and like it more than my previous computer**

*Description of performance based on hardware: I have not had this computer for very long so I can't really speak for its performance and harware, howver is is noticeably faster than my old computer whih could be due to this computer having more RAM and a more powerful CPU*
